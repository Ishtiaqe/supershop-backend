 This file used to be the Cloud Run Hello World express server that served
 `index.html.hbs`. The project now uses a Nest.js backend in `src/` with
 `dist/main.js` as the runtime entrypoint. Keep this file only for reference.

 If you want to remove the hello-world example entirely, delete this file and
 the `index.html.hbs` template.
